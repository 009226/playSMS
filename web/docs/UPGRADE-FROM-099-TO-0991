Upgrade to playSMS version 0.9.9.1 from unmodified playSMS version 0.9.9

Assumed that your old playSMS (0.9.9) was installed like this:
- Your playSMS 0.9.9 web location is in /var/www/playsms/
- Your playSMS 0.9.9 daemon files location are in /usr/local/bin/
- Your playSMS 0.9.9 database name is playsms

And, assumed that your new playSMS (0.9.9.1) was extracted at:
- /usr/local/src/playsms-0.9.9.1

Follow below steps carefully to upgrade from unmodified 0.9.9 to 0.9.9.1:

1. Stop playsmsd and sendsmsd:

	/etc/init.d/playsms stop

2. Move and backup old files (please note on the 'slash'):

	mkdir -p /root/backup-0.9.9/www
	mv /var/www/playsms/* /root/backup-0.9.9/www/

3. Quick install new files and copy old config.php:

	cd /usr/local/src/playsms-0.9.9.1
	cp -rR web/* /var/www/playsms/
	cp /root/backup-0.9.9/www/config.php /var/www/playsms/

4. Start again playsmsd and sendsmsd:

	/etc/init.d/playsms start

5. Upgrade complete, browse playSMS as usual.
