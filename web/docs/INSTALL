UPGRADE
-------
We do not provide a way to upgrade until version 1.0. But anyway, simply copying new files from 
this package into old playsms installation, replacing old files, should do the trick.

   
INSTALLATION on Linux
---------------------
Note:
- I assumed that you have root priviledge. If you dont, understand that im trying to 
  guide you to install playSMS on /var/www/playsms under user 'playsms'. You may use your own
  username, your own home directory or any preferred directory.
- This installation instructions might be working for other *NIX based operating system, 
  I know someone installing playSMS on FreeBSD and it work just fine.

playSMS Web Interface:
1.  It is important to meet all minimum requiments above
2.  Setup a system user named 'playsms' to manage playSMS
    # adduser playsms
    # passwd playsms
    Note: on some Linux distributions adduser and passwd combined (Debian, Ubuntu and maybe others)
3.  On most Linux distributions actions (2) will create system user and group named 'playsms'
    with home directory /home/playsms, but you will install playSMS in different directory
4.  Create playSMS web root, spool and log and set ownership to user www-data or web server user
    # mkdir -p /var/www/playsms
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/playsms
    # mkdir -p /var/log/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/spool/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/log/playsms
5.  Extract playSMS package somewhere (Usually in /usr/local/src)
    # tar -zxvf playsms-x.x.x.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src
    Note: x.x.x may vary according to the package name you've download
6.  Copy files and directories inside 'web' directory to playSMS web root and set ownership again to 
    user www-data or apache web server user
    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/web
    # cp -rR * /var/www/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms
    Note: assumed your web server user is www-data
7.  Setup database (import database)
    # mysqladmin -u root -p create playsms
    # mysql -u root -p playsms < /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/db/playsms.sql
    Note: you dont need to use MySQL root access nor this method to setup playSMS
    database, but this is beyond our scope, you should read MySQL manual's for custom
    installation method or howto insert SQL statements into existing database
8.  Copy config-dist.php to config.php and edit config.php
    # cd /var/www/playsms
    # cp config-dist.php config.php
    # mcedit config.php
    or 
    # vi config.php
    Note: please read and fill all required fields with coutious
9.  Enter bin directory, copy playsms, playsmsd, playsmsd.php, playsmsd_start to directory default
    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/bin
    # cp playsmsd playsmsd.php playsmsd_start /usr/local/bin/
    # cp playsms /etc/default/
    Note: please note the different between playsms and playsmsd
10. Look for rc.local on /etc and its subdirectories (usualy /etc, /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
    Edit rc.local and put: 
    "/usr/local/bin/playsmsd_start" (without quotes)
    on the bottom of the file (before exit if theres exit command). This way playsmsd_start 
    will start automatically on boot. 
    Note: you need 'root' access to do this
11  Browse http://localhost/playsms/ and login using default administrator user
    username: admin
    password: admin
12. At this point you should be able to login to playSMS web interface and manage playSMS

Please continue to follow INSTALL_GNOKII if you want to use gnokii as your gateway module, 
or INSTALL_SMSSERVERTOOLS to use SMS Server Tools, or INSTALL_KANNEL if you want to use 
kannel instead.
