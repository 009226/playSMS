INSTALLATION on Linux
---------------------
Note:
- I assumed that you have root priviledge. If you dont, please understand that I'm trying to
  guide you to install playSMS on /var/www/playsms under user 'playsms'. You may use your own
  username, your own home directory or any preferred directory.
- This installation instructions might be working for other *NIX based operating system.
  I knew someone installing playSMS on FreeBSD and it worked.

playSMS Web Interface step-by-step installation:

1.  It is important to meet all minimum requiments above. Those application should also be working 
    and running properly

2.  Setup a Linux user named 'playsms' to manage playSMS. Make sure that you logged in as root.
    # adduser playsms
    # passwd playsms
    Note: on some Linux distributions adduser and passwd are combined (eg: Debian and Ubuntu)

3.  On most Linux distributions point 2 above will create a user and a group named 'playsms'
    with home directory /home/playsms (this directory does not mean anything to playSMS)

4.  Create playSMS web root, spool and log and set ownership to user www-data or web server user
    # mkdir -p /var/www/playsms
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/playsms
    # mkdir -p /var/log/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/spool/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/log/playsms
    Note: There are Linux distributions using 'apache' as web server user instead of 'www-data'.

5.  Extract playSMS package somewhere (Usually in /usr/local/src).
    # tar -zxvf playsms-x.x.x.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src
    Note: x.x.x may vary according to the package name you've download.

6.  Copy files and directories inside 'web' directory to playSMS web root and set ownership again to
    user www-data or web server user
    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/web
    # cp -rR * /var/www/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms
    Note: Assumed your web server user is www-data, see notes on point 4 above.

7.  Setup database (import database)
    # mysqladmin -u root -p create playsms
    # mysql -u root -p playsms < /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/db/playsms.sql
    Note: You don't need to use MySQL root access nor this method to setup playSMS
    database, but this is beyond our scope. You should read MySQL manual for custom
    installation method or howto insert SQL statements into existing database.

8.  Copy config-dist.php to config.php and then edit config.php
    # cd /var/www/playsms
    # cp config-dist.php config.php
    # mcedit config.php
    or
    # vi config.php
    Note: Please read and fill all required fields with coutious.

9.  Enter bin directory, copy playsms, playsmsd* and sendsmsd*
    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/bin
    # cp playsms /etc/default/
    # cp playsmsd playsmsd.php playsmsd_start playsmsd_stop /usr/local/bin/
    # cp sendsmsd sendsmsd.php /usr/local/bin/
    Note: Please note the difference between playsms and playsmsd, one is a config file the other
    are playSMS daemon scripts.
    These playSMS daemon script files must be exists in /usr/local/bin:
    - playsmsd
    - playsmsd.php
    - playsmsd_start
    - playsmsd_stop
    - sendsmsd
    - sendsmsd.php

10. Just to make sure every paths are correct, please edit /etc/default/playsms
    # vi /etc/default/playsms
    Make sure that PLAYSMS_PATH is pointing to a correct playSMS installation path, and also make
    sure that PLAYSMS_BIN is pointing to a correct playSMS daemon scripts path.

11. Look for rc.local on /etc and its subdirectories (usualy /etc, /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d).
    If you found it then edit that rc.local and put:
    "/usr/local/bin/playsmsd_start" (without quotes)
    on the bottom of the file (before exit if theres an exit command). This way playsmsd_start
    will start automatically on boot.
    Note: Just like any other steps above you need 'root' access to do this.

12. Run playsmsd_start manually
    # /usr/local/bin/playsmsd_start
    Note:
    - after that please do a ps -ax and see if playsmsd and sendsmsd are running
    - stop here and review your installation steps when playsmsd and sendsmsd aren't running
    - consider to ask question in playSMS mailing list when you encountered any problem

13. Browse http://localhost/playsms/ and login using default administrator user
    username: admin
    password: admin

14. At this point you should be able to login to playSMS web interface and manage playSMS

Please continue to follow INSTALL_SMSSERVERTOOLS to use SMS Server Tools (smstools3) as your gateway
module, or follow INSTALL_KANNEL if you want to use Kannel instead.

Gnokii and Gammu also supported, please follow INSTALL_GNOKII if you want to use Gnokii as your
gateway module, or INSTALL_GAMMU if you want to use Gammu instead.

As of playSMS version 0.9.5 using Kannel or SMS Server Tools (smstools3) is preferrable.
