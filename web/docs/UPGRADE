UPGRADE
-------
Currently, upgrade only available for unmodified playSMS version 0.9.4.

Steps to upgrade:
1. Backup your old playSMS 0.9.4 installation files, folders and database.
2. Move your old playSMS 0.9.4 to another location
3. Do the installation process for new playSMS version 0.9.5
4. Read the old config.php from playSMS 0.9.4 and apply the configuration in new config.php
5. Update database by inserting SQL patch file: db/playsms-upgrade-094-to-095.sql
6. Highly recommended, to make sure that your database default charset is utf8

# cd {playSMS 0.9.5 package directory}/db
# mysql -u {database username} -p {playSMS 0.9.4 database name} < playsms-upgrade-094-to-095.sql

Regarding point 6 above, my dummy-way was to SQL export/dump with drop tables to an SQL file, 
and then edit that SQL file and replace latin1 (if its latin1) with utf8. Re-import SQL file 
once replaced all with utf8.
