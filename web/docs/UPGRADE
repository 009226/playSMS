UPGRADE
-------
We do not provide special way to upgrade until version 1.0. But anyway, simply copying new files 
from this package into old playSMS installation, replacing old files, replace and re-apply old
configuration to new config.php, should do the trick.

We do provide database upgrade for playSMS 0.9.4 upgrade to version 0.9.5, please check the SQL 
patch file: db/playsms-upgrade-094-to-095.sql

# cd {playSMS 0.9.5 package directory}/db
# mysql -u {database username} -p {playSMS 0.9.4 database name} < playsms-upgrade-094-to-095.sql
