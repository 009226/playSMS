Replace bootstrap.min.css with other bootstrap.min.* for different color sets.

For example if you want to see Ubuntu colors in your themes then replace
bootstrap.min.css with bootstrap.min.ubuntu.css

# cp bootstrap.min.ubuntu.css bootstrap.min.css

Note that by default bootstrap.min.css is the same as bootstrap.min.orig.css

Also note that the Ubuntu css and Flatly css are suppose to be used on Internet
because it requires to get fonts from CDN. When you apply it locally without the
Internet it will slow you down.
